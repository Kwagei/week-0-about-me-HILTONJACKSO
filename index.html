            <p>Hi, I'm Hilton! I'm from Liberia and I am the founder of Enjoy Liberia
                I started Enjoy Liberia beause I have a strong passion for tourism.
                After many years of trying to find a job that reflected my love for 
                tourism, I decided to take matters into my own hands and start my own business.
                Enjoy Liberia is a One stop shop digital tourism guide that provides tourist
                with information about major attraction and accommodation, restaurant, entertainment and 
                rental services in liberia.
                I know this is suppose to be about me but to be true I am all tourism.
            </p>
            <p><strong>My Experience in KIT</strong><br>
            KIT is not like our ordinary Liberian school, for the past two weeks
        we have been pushed to learn things that we thought we could learn in months,
    I love the learning environment and I wish we can continue like this, so far 
I think going to KIT was the best decision I may this year.<br>
